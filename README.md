# splitwise_clone

A lightweight, object-oriented **Splitwise clone** implemented in C++, designed using **Low-Level Design (LLD)** principles and clean **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** architecture. The system models the core functionalities of expense sharing between users, including group-wise expense splitting, balance tracking, and simplified settlements.

This project replicates the key functionalities of **Splitwise**, focusing on **design clarity**, **scalability**, and **extensibility** rather than a UI or persistent database. Itâ€™s ideal for practicing **LLD concepts** such as class design, object relationships, and clean separation of concerns.

Features:
-Add users and maintain individual ledgers.

-Record expenses with **equal or exact splits**.

-Real-time tracking of who owes whom and how much.

-Easily extendable to add new split types or payment modes.

Learning Outcomes:
-Practiced real-world Low-Level Design (LLD) in C++

-Applied OOP principles in building scalable systems

-Understood how to model real-world scenarios in code
